puts "Samra " + "Girma"
puts "Samra" + " Girma"


#The instructions call two add two strings together.
#The following examples contain more/less than two strings.
#However, they are also forms of concatenation.
#(The latter is interpolation, but still involves concatenation).

puts "Samra" + " " + "Girma"

first_name = "Samra"
last_name = "Girma"

puts "Hi, my name is #{first_name} #{last_name}"
